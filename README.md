# Information_Security_Analysis_and_Audit
My lab materials for the Information Security Analysis and Audit course are located in this repository. Source code, tools, and documentation that I produced as part of my coursework are included in the files.

Each lab file offers a brief explanation of the project's goal and functioning and corresponds to a particular Information Security principle or application. Network analysis, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing are just a few of the topics covered in the files, which are arranged according to lab session.

Documentation that gives a summary of the information security concepts employed and the outcomes is also included in the lab files. Anyone interested in information security analysis and audit, or who wants to increase their knowledge and abilities, can use this documentation as a reference manual.
